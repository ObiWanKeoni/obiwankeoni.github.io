### About

I always thought software engineering was out of reach, that I was simply too dumb to learn it even though it pulled at me subtly. Back in 2016, the curriculum for a Petroleum Engineering degree required a programming course. I chose C++ and **fell in love** with code.

I would have pursued a CS degree if I wouldn't have had to retake a year at University so I finished my Community College degree and jumped headfirst into a coding bootcamp. Now I am a software engineer with experience across a variety of industries and a proven track record of delivering value to businesses for whom I have worked.

More importantly, though, I am a father to one wonderful little boy (Dakota 2) and a mediocre husband to my beautiful wife (Jamie 26). My hobbies include ergonomics, keyboards, and [creative writing](/writing/) (mainly Lovecraftian Horror).

Interested in working together? Reach out at my [email](mailto:keoni_garner@yahoo.com)
