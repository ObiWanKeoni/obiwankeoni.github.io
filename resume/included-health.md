## Okay but what did ***YOU*** do?

- Designed and implemented the architecture of a microservice which contained a third-party integration with an ePrescription provider that would produce ~$20M in prescription revenue.
- After a year, I was promoted to Senior Software Engineer and became the tech lead of the ePrescribing service, owning all facets including (but not limited to) performance monitoring, CI/CD, and AWS infrastructure.
- Implemented an event-driven architecture via SNS and SQS on AWS.
- Developed and implemented internal Python libraries for highly specific use cases.
- Consistently met with a Product Manager and several UI/UX designers as a technical expert to scope features.
