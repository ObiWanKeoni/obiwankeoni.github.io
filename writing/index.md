# Writing
{: .no_toc }

My most creative hobby. I draw heavy inspiration from individual authors at a given time so you’ll find the style is varying. I see that as a challenge and I like developing my different styles and forms of writing.

Some inspirations include:
- Shirley Jackson
- H.P. Lovecraft (just the writing… not the racism)
- Mary Shelley
- Blake Crouch
