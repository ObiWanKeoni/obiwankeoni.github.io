In this post, I will give you everything you need to speak intelligently about a topic that will almost never present itself organically in random conversations - ergonomic mechanical keyboards. If you have no idea what I'm talking about OR you do and you have no idea where to get started, this post is for you.

### History Lesson

Christopher Latham Sholes is a rarely-remembered member (say that 3 times fast...) of the American Industrialists, yet it is more likely that you interact with his inventions every day than, say, Henry Ford. Sholes, while disputed as the inventor of the typewriter, is certainly the inventor of the dominant layout for it and each of its predecessors... QWERTY. The [Remington No. 2](https://americanhistory.si.edu/collections/search/object/nmah_687313) typewriter was invented in 1878 saw incredible commercial success as it was the first model to include a <kbd>â‡§ shift</kbd> key which allowed tying both capital and lowercase letters. This success all but solidified QWERTY as the masses got more acclimated and, thus, more resistant to change. The vast majority of typewriter or keyboard products for the following 150 years would use QWERTY.

**Aside** QWERTY is not really a terrible layout - in fact it functions rather well for modern browsing which typically includes (for right handed folks) a mouse in the right hand. QWERTY is left-hand dominant in that many English words can be typed with only the left hand. This makes for great one handed typing while using the mouse to browse. It is, however, only one layout so I always suggest experimentation. Don't just [cut off the ends of the ham](https://executiveforum.com/cutting-off-the-ends-of-the-ham/).

Key layouts actually already see a lot of discourse among different communities which has led to the major OS support for remapping a keyboard to an alternative layout (Colemak, Dvorak, etc.). What's talked about less though is the **position** and **orientation** of the keys themselves. Have you ever wondered why the keys are oriented in diagonal columns? Well it might surprise you to know that it was merely a limitation of the typewriter design at the time. The levers for each key needed to be equally aligned in the half circle so they could cleanly fit under the page. In order to accommodate this, Sholes and Glidden staggered the rows of the typewriter. As the QWERTY dependency grew by year, the row-staggered orientation came along with it. 

That's the history lesson. Not so bad right? Let's get into the juicy bits now - the world of ergonomic keyboards.

## Ergonomic Keyboards

> What even are *ergonomics*?

Honestly, you'll probably get a different definition from ergonomists, corporate executives, and hobbyists like myself. What I can give you though is what I would define it as: **Adjusting your work environment to reduce risk of injury and discomfort.** What might surprise you is that what will be ergonomic for me is not what will be ergonomic for you, so take everything with a grain of salt - try it out if you're able and see what works for you.

### Membrane Keyboards
These are usually the first think you think of when you hear "ergonomic keyboard". They are often sculpted keyboards that are usually very cheap. I advise staying away from these as they provide very little benefit over a flat keyboard. The goal for these is that your hands will be slightly less prone which can help ulnar-torsion-related RSI, but if the keyboard is really cheap, you might end up with keys getting stuck or the wear and tear may be horrendous so you'd be reversing your benefits by mashing the keys to get a proper stroke. If you must have one of these keyboards, I will only recommend the Microsoft Sculpt Keyboard which is already pretty steep (at around $100). The cost of this could be better put toward a different type of keyboard that you can remap to your liking.

### Mecha-Membrane Keyboards
Razer is the king of these. These combine the low cost nature of membrane keyboards with a mechanical-like feel. Purists might tell you that it feels nothing like a mechanical keyboard and that wouldn't be totally incorrect - the membrane mechanism is simply too different from the mechanical switch that the feel cannot be identically replicated. It's honestly pretty close though if you have a tight budget. I have yet to see a tented, sculpted, or split version of this but any keyboard that will get you to type less is a good one.

### Mechanical Keyboards
These are often very loud and present only nominal benefits to (mecha-)membrane keyboards. One benefit is the key mechanism - the additional key travel length means you don't need to bottom-out (push the key all the way down to the bottom of the board) in order to get a stroke. You can theoretically float your hands above the keyboard and reduce impact on your fingers. This is, however, extremely hard to do consistently so it's not advised that you rely on this for your ergonomics. The other benefit is that you typically have the ability to re-map the layout. If the keyboard supports QMK/Via(l) or ZMK firmware, then you can move keys around and add key combos, chording, macros, you name it! Customization is its own form of ergonomics because you can move keys to the places that make the most sense for you, your hands, and your typing style.
For entry-level value, you really can't beat Nuphy or Keychron here.
