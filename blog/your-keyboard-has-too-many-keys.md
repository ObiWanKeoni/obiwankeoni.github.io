### History Lesson

Christopher Latham Sholes is a rarely-remembered member (say that 3 times fast...) of the American Industrialists, yet it is more likely that you interact with his inventions every day than, say, Henry Ford. Sholes, while disputed as the inventor of the typewriter, is certainly the inventor of the dominant layout for it and each of its predecessors... QWERTY. The [Remington No. 2](https://americanhistory.si.edu/collections/search/object/nmah_687313) typewriter was invented in 1878 saw incredible commercial success as it was the first model to include a <kbd>â‡§ shift</kbd> key which allowed tying both capital and lowercase letters. This success all but solidified QWERTY as the masses got more acclimated and, thus, more resistant to change. The vast majority of typewriter or keyboard products for the following 150 years would use QWERTY.

{: .note}
**Aside**: QWERTY is not really a terrible layout - in fact it functions rather well for modern browsing which typically includes (for right handed folks) a mouse in the right hand. QWERTY is left-hand dominant in that many English words can be typed with only the left hand. This makes for great one handed typing while using the mouse to browse. It is, however, only one layout so I always suggest experimentation. Don't just [cut off the ends of the ham](https://executiveforum.com/cutting-off-the-ends-of-the-ham/).

Key layouts actually already see a lot of discourse among different communities which has led to the major OS support for remapping a keyboard to an alternative layout (Colemak, Dvorak, etc.). What's talked about less though is the **position** and **orientation** of the keys themselves. Have you ever wondered why the keys are oriented in diagonal columns? Well it might surprise you to know that it was merely a limitation of the typewriter design at the time. The levers for each key needed to be equally aligned in the half circle so they could cleanly fit under the page. In order to accommodate this, Sholes and Glidden staggered the rows of the typewriter. As the QWERTY dependency grew by year, the row-staggered orientation came along with it. 

That's the history lesson. Not so bad right? Let's get into the juicy bits now - the world of ergonomic keyboards.

## The World of Ergonomic Keyboards

> *Ergonomics*: A buzzword, or the real deal?

From professional ergonomists to everyday enthusiasts like yours truly, everyone seems to have a unique take on what "ergonomics" truly means. My two cents? It's all about **modifying your workspace to minimize discomfort and prevent injuries**. A fun tidbit? What's ergonomic for me might be as strange as a *mechanical keyboard* at a typewriter convention for you! The key (pun intended) is to experiment and find out what feels right for you.

Now, when it comes to *programmable keyboards*, especially the *split keyboards*, there are several features that can elevate the ergonomic experience. Here are the main features we'll be tapping into today:

 1. **Form Factor**
	 1. Structure
		 1. Split (because who doesnâ€™t love a good divide?)
		 2. Unibody (one for all, all in one)
		 3. Monoblock (keeping it old school)
	 2. Keyboard Orientation
		 1. Tented/Sculpted (for when flat is too... flat)
		 2. Keywells (it's all about the depth)
		 3. Flat (simplicity at its finest)
	 3. Key Positioning
		 1. Row Staggered (classic alignment)
		 2. Column Staggered (mixing it up)
		 3. Ortholinear (straight as an arrow)
 2. **Mobility** (because we arenâ€™t always desk-bound)
 3. **Trigger Mechanism** (mechanical keyboards, anyone?)
 4. **Programmability** (tailor it to your whims and fancies)
 5. **Number of Keys** (more isnâ€™t always merrier)

For reference, if we were to describe a 'standard' keyboard based on the features mentioned above, it'd look a little something like this:

1. Form Factor:
	1. Structure: Unibody (all together now)
	2. Keyboard Orientation: Flat (no frills)
	3. Key Positioning: Row Staggered (good ol' alignment)
2. Mobility: Semi-Mobile (somewhere between here and there)
3. Trigger Mechanism: Membrane (smooth and silent)
4. Programmability: Non-programmable (what you see is what you get)
5. Number of Keys: 104 keys (the magic number)

{: .note}
Just remember, any keyboard can wave the ergonomic flag given the right circumstances. Always key-p an open mind! ðŸ˜‰

### The Ergonomic Magic Behind Form Factors
When it comes to keyboards, particularly *mechanical keyboards* and their ergonomic brethren, the structure plays a pivotal role in user comfort. Let's face it â€“ the keyboard's structure influences every other feature. While the dream is to have a keyboard that lets you tweak everything to your heart's content, reality often nudges us to make some trade-offs. Fear not! There are specific perks associated with each structure type that'll surely cater to your individual ergonomic needs.

#### Dive Into Structure
Before we delve deep, let's decode the structural jargon:

**Split**: Ever thought of giving each hand its own keyboard domain? That's the idea behind split keyboards, divided into two distinct halves.

**Unibody**: This is the keyboard most of us are familiar with. It's a singular piece, with keys placed close together in a seamless layout.

**Monoblock**: A delightful blend of the split and unibody. Itâ€™s a single structure, but thereâ€™s a clear demarcation for each hand, often accompanied by a slight tilt or noticeable separation.

> **To Split or Not to Split?**

Pondering over this? Here's why you might consider splitting up:

1. Treat your wrists to a natural alignment during typing sessions.
2. Let your shoulders relax and fall in line with your body.

With the freedom to position each half, you can reduce stress on your wrists and shoulders. But remember, great ergonomics often come with a side dish of complexity. A wired split keyboard, for instance, means managing an extra cable and juggling two separate pieces if you're on the move.

> **Why Stick with the Unibody Familiarity?**

Despite the ergonomic allure of split keyboards, there are legit reasons to stay loyal to the unibody:

1. Occasionally typing with one hand? Unibody's got your back.
2. Enjoying the broader tech compatibility of mainstream keyboards.
3. Not haunted by wrist or shoulder aches? Then why fix what ain't broke?

> **Monoblock - The Middle Ground?**

Monoblock is like that versatile friend who's good at everything but doesn't quite steal the show. It combines the ergonomic nods of a split design (hello, happy wrists!) with the mobility ease of a unibody. If youâ€™re wary of wrist strains but still yearn for a single piece, monoblock might just be your ergonomic superhero.

With wrist and shoulder comfort sorted, let's venture next into the realm of elbow and hand solace.

#### Decoding Keyboard Orientation
Keyboard orientation isn't just about aesthetics. It's a blend of science, user comfort, and sometimes, a dash of individual quirks. Here, we delve into the trio that rule the roost: Tenting/Sculpting, Keywells, and the classic Flat.

##### Tenting/Sculpting: Where Ergonomics Meet Design
Tenting for split keyboards is like giving your board wings, letting each half angle laterally. This arrangement eases arm twists compared to its flat counterpart. On the other side, we have sculpting for unibody and monoblock designs, where the board gently arcs towards the user, minimizing arm torsion. If, like me, you have that pesky cubital tunnel syndrome or general elbow RSI, this design can be your savior by lessening ulnar twists. But a word of caution: while tenting can offer relief, don't hinge your entire decision to go split on this feature alone.

##### Keywells: Not Just a Design Quirk
Exclusively a feature of *split keyboards*, the keywell offers a cool dip where each key settles along a concave curve. Beyond being an eye-catching design element (and a great icebreaker!), keywells are champions of ergonomics. They reduce finger travel, and the unique curve allows for unconventional finger movements to hit the keys. Battling hand pain or wary of it? Keywells might just be the ergonomic companion your hands yearn for.

##### Flat: The Evergreen Classic
Flat keyboards are like the dependable buddy you've always known - ubiquitous, aligning with mainstream typing practices, and utterly reliable. They're especially nifty for chording (and if you're raising an eyebrow at 'chording', hang on till we dive into the *programmability* realm!). Absent specific discomforts that could be eased by tenting or keywells, a flat keyboard remains a timeless choice.

Intrigued? Let's continue our ergonomic journey!

#### The Art of Key Positioning
Positioning is more than just about where the keys are locatedâ€”it's about marrying ergonomics with functionality. And with this beautiful image to guide us, let's dive deep into the world of key arrangements!

##### Row Staggered: The Traditionalist
Row staggered layout is reminiscent of the classic typewriter, where keys cascade in diagonal rows. While following tradition might seem intuitive, this design, surprisingly, doesn't offer much in ergonomic benefits. As we touched upon in our [introductory section](#history-lesson), this layout is an heirloom from the typewriter days, borne out of necessity rather than optimization. Nevertheless, its omnipresence and our embedded muscle memory can make venturing away from this layout a daunting task.

##### Column Staggered: A Natural Fit
Tailored to the average human finger's natural variance in length, the column staggered design adjusts columns to mirror a relaxed hand position. The objective? Ensuring each finger rests comfortably on the home row. The uniform columns mean the most frequently-used keys lie within a fingertip's reach, minimizing the strain-inducing lateral motions. 

{: note}
Speaking of fine-tuning to the human hand, there's "splay"â€”a design tweak that aligns the columns to the natural splay of our fingers. By replicating the relaxed spacing of the fingers, it champions a more natural typing stance. While it has its set of aficionados, it's worth noting that splay can pose challenges, especially when it comes to chording.

##### Ortholinear: The Uniform Rebel
Going against the grain, the ortholinear layout arranges keys in a neat grid. Each key sits equidistant from its neighbors, providing the ergonomic perks of column staggering, like minimizing lateral motion. But here's the catch: unless your fingers are all uniformly sized (a rarity, indeed!), this might not be the most ergonomic choice. You might find yourself cramping your hand to achieve the correct typing stance. However, for those who dance on their keyboards with chords, the ortholinear layout is a dream come true, making multi-key presses a breeze.

In the realm of *mechanical keyboards*, positioning plays a crucial role in ergonomics. Choose wisely, and you'll find your fingers gliding effortlessly across the board!

### The Mobility Equation

When we talk about ergonomics, we often overlook a crucial aspect: mobility. The ability to shift, adjust, and move your setup is a powerful weapon against the lurking risks of RSI. Here's why it matters and what you need to consider.

#### Why Mobility Matters

Ergonomic experts sing praises about the benefits of regular position changes. Think about it: humans aren't designed to remain static for long hours. By promoting a mobile setup, you're not only breaking the monotony but also encouraging micro-movements, which can prevent muscle stiffness and maintain a healthy posture. If you're someone battling the woes of a sedentary lifestyle, a mobile setup can be a lifesaver. It simplifies the act of leaving the desk, leading to more breaks and stretching sessions.

#### Wired vs Wireless: The Great Debate

Wired keyboards, with their tangle-prone cords, can often be cumbersome, especially if you're aiming for a mobile setup. The equation gets trickier with split keyboards, which not only have a cord tethering the two halves but also the added task of moving both sections.

From an ergonomic standpoint, wireless keyboards take the cake. The freedom from cords means easier movement and adaptability. You can shift your posture, lean back, or even stand, all without being restricted by wires.

But, there's always a trade-off. Wired connections bring reliability and speed to the table. There's no fretting over battery life or sporadic Bluetooth disconnections. And for gamers or professional typists, that instantaneous response time can be paramount.

However, if mobility is your priority, wireless is the way to go. Even with split keyboards, innovations are making portability less of a challenge. With some [creative solutions](https://links.net/re/equip/ergoapron/), you might just find a wireless split keyboard more mobile than its unibody counterpart!

In the realm of _ergonomic keyboards_, mobility isn't just a perkâ€”it's an essential feature. Whether you opt for the reliability of wired or the freedom of wireless, ensure your choice aligns with your ergonomic goals.

### Delving Deeper: The Importance of the Trigger Mechanism
The way you press a key, and the response it provides, is more than just a tactile experience; it affects the overall ergonomics of the keyboard, influencing the level of strain on your fingers and the amount of effort required to type. Let's break down the intricacies:

#### Membrane Keyboards
Common and affordable, membrane keyboards can be the entry point for many into the world of ergonomics. However, it's vital to invest in quality. A cheap membrane keyboard can pose more harm than good by necessitating forceful key presses and not providing adequate feedback. The Microsoft Sculpt Keyboard stands out in this category due to its reliable performance and relative ergonomic benefits. 

#### Mecha-Membrane Keyboards
For those looking for a bridge between membrane and mechanical keyboards, the mecha-membrane is a suitable option. While it may not deliver the pure mechanical experience, it gets close and is budget-friendly. But, as of the last update, ergonomic adaptations in this category seem limited.

#### Mechanical Keyboards
A darling for typists and gamers, mechanical keyboards offer the benefit of distinct tactile feedback, allowing for a more controlled typing experience. While they can be noisy, their customizable nature is where they shine, especially in ergonomics. Being able to modify key functions and layouts can adjust the keyboard to fit one's specific needs, reducing unnecessary hand movements. Brands like Nuphy and Keychron have become popular for providing good value.

#### Diving into the Obscure
For those who seek specialization or have unique requirements, there are some lesser-known yet effective mechanisms:

- **Topre Switches**: These are renowned for offering a blend of tactile and smooth experiences, bridging the gap between rubber dome and mechanical switches.
  
- **Scissor/Butterfly Switches**: These switches are familiar to Apple users. While the butterfly mechanism had its issues, the underlying principle was to provide a stable keypress with minimal movement. The scissor switch, meanwhile, is reliable and offers a pleasant typing experience.
  
- **Datahand and Datahand-like**: The original Datahand revolutionized ergonomic typing. With keys positioned around each finger, it minimizes hand movement. Later innovations like Lalboard and Svalboard have drawn inspiration from this concept.
  
- **Joysticks**: Devices like Charachorder and Sherbet introduce a radically different approach to typing, leveraging joystick-like mechanisms to reduce the number of keys and hand movement.

In conclusion, the trigger mechanism is not just about the tactile feel but also about how it affects the typing dynamics. Finding the right balance between comfort, functionality, and ergonomics requires an understanding of these mechanisms and their implications. Whether you're a purist or an innovator, there's a keyboard out there tailored for your ergonomic needs.

### The Power of Customization: Why Programming Matters in Ergonomics

When you hear "keyboard programmability," your thoughts might gravitate towards customization and personalization. But at its core, it's an ergonomic tool. By redefining key functions and placements, you're ensuring that the keyboard works for you, rather than you working (and often straining) to fit the keyboard's design. Here's why programmability makes a significant ergonomic difference:

#### Minimized Hand Movement
By programming certain keys to perform multiple tasks, you can drastically reduce the need to stretch fingers or move hands. The idea of home row mods exemplifies this. With the dual-functionality of keys (acting as both letters and modifiers), it simplifies complicated key combinations and encourages your hands to remain in the natural, relaxed position of the home row. 

#### Layers Are a Game Changer
Many programmable keyboards support layers. This means that with a single key press, your entire keyboard layout can switch to a different configuration. Imagine switching from a standard typing layer to a specialized layer for a specific software, gaming, or multimedia control, all at the press of a button. Layers enable you to bring distant keys closer and can be tailor-made to specific tasks, further enhancing ergonomic efficiency.

#### Paving the Way for Efficient Typing
Reduced key layouts, like Miryoku, offer all the functionalities of a full-sized keyboard but in a compact space. The magic lies in intelligent programming. By assigning multiple roles to a single key (based on taps, holds, or combinations), you can maintain the breadth of keyboard functionality without the width.

#### Macros and Macro Pads: Boosting Efficiency
For tasks you frequently perform, why go through a series of key presses when one key can do the job? Macros allow you to assign a sequence of actions to a single key. Moreover, macro pads, which are auxiliary keypads with programmable keys, provide an extra layer of customization. Whether it's launching an application, executing a command, or typing a commonly used phrase, macro pads are ergonomic enhancers that place more control at your fingertips without the added strain.

#### The Learning Curve and Rewards
It's essential to acknowledge that diving into the world of programmable keyboards can initially feel overwhelming. But with time, as you mold the keyboard to fit your needs, the ergonomic benefits are unparalleled. You not only type more comfortably but also faster and more efficiently.

In essence, a programmable keyboard transforms from a mere input device to an ergonomic tool shaped by and for you. It's about marrying comfort with efficiency and reaping the long-term benefits of reduced strain and enhanced productivity.

### The Balance of Minimalism and Functionality

Modern keyboards come packed with keys, but do we really use all of them? The standard 104-key (or 100% layout) has been a convention for decades, and while it provides every function and feature you could think of, it also creates a wide expanse of real estate that our fingers need to traverse.

The rise in popularity of 75%, 60%, and 40% keyboards in the mechanical keyboard community underscores the desire to streamline the typing experience. But is there such a thing as going too far? Let's delve into the idea of minimalism versus functionality in keyboards.

#### Benefits of Reducing Keys:
1. **Less Finger Travel**: Fewer keys mean your fingers remain closer to the home row. This can lead to faster typing speeds and reduced fatigue.
2. **Ergonomic Advantages**: Compact layouts tend to reduce the amount of hand movement and wrist strain.
3. **Portable**: Smaller keyboards are easy to carry around, making them great for on-the-go setups.

#### Embracing Layers:
The beauty of modern programmable keyboards is the ability to use layers. Instead of having a dedicated key for every function, layers allow multiple functions on a single key. For example, holding a specific "layer key" can transform your regular alphanumeric keys into a numpad, function keys, or even multimedia controls.

#### The Endgame:
The term "endgame" in the keyboard community represents the pursuit of a perfect keyboard. It's a balance between aesthetics, functionality, and comfort. Reducing keys plays a significant role in this quest. By challenging the norms and reimagining the keyboard layout, enthusiasts are pushing the boundaries of what's possible.

However, it's essential to recognize that minimalism is a journey, not a destination. What's comfortable and efficient for one person might not work for another. The 34-key layout of the "Sweep" is an excellent example of extreme minimalism, but it might not be everyone's cup of tea.

#### Final Thoughts:
While the trend is moving towards fewer keys, it's crucial to prioritize functionality and comfort. It's not about how few keys you can get away with, but rather how you can streamline your typing experience without compromising efficiency. Remember, the ultimate goal is to have a keyboard that feels intuitive, reduces strain, and elevates your typing experience. Whether that's with 104 keys or 34 is up to individual preference and adaptability.

## Conclusion
The ideal ergonomic keyboard varies based on individual needs. The balance is between reducing unnecessary keys and maintaining functionality, all in the pursuit of comfort and efficiency.
