In this post, I will give you everything you need to speak intelligently about a topic that will almost never present itself organically in random conversations - ergonomic mechanical keyboards. If you have no idea what I'm talking about OR you do and you have no idea where to get started, this post is for you.

### History Lesson

Christopher Latham Sholes is a rarely-remembered member (say that 3 times fast...) of the American Industrialists, yet it is more likely that you interact with his inventions every day than, say, Henry Ford. Sholes, while disputed as the inventor of the typewriter, is certainly the inventor of the dominant layout for it and each of its predecessors... QWERTY. The [Remington No. 2](https://americanhistory.si.edu/collections/search/object/nmah_687313) typewriter was invented in 1878 saw incredible commercial success as it was the first model to include a <kbd>â‡§shift</kbd> key which allowed tying both capital and lowercase letters. This success all but solidified QWERTY as the masses got more acclimated and, thus, more resistant to change. The vast majority of typewriter or keyboard products for the following 150 years would use QWERTY.

**Aside** QWERTY is not really a terrible layout - in fact it functions rather well for modern browsing which typically includes (for right handed folks) a mouse in the right hand. QWERTY is left-hand dominant in that many English words can be typed with only the left hand. This makes for great one handed typing while using the mouse to browse. It is, however, only one layout so I always suggest experimentation. Don't just [cut off the ends of the ham](https://executiveforum.com/cutting-off-the-ends-of-the-ham/).

Key layouts actually already see a lot of discourse among different communities which has led to the major OS support for remapping a keyboard to an alternative layout (Colemak, Dvorak, etc.). What's talked about less though is the **position** and **orientation** of the keys themselves. Have you ever wondered why the keys are oriented in diagonal columns? Well it might surprise you to know that it was merely a limitation of the typewriter design at the time. The levers for each key needed to be equally aligned in the half circle so they could cleanly fit under the page. In order to accommodate this, Sholes and Glidden staggered the rows of the typewriter. As the QWERTY dependency grew by year, the row-staggered orientation came along with it. 

That's the history lesson. Not so bad right? Let's get into the juicy bits now - the world of ergonomic keyboards.
