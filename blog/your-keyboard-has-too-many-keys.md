In this post, I will give you everything you need to speak intelligently about a topic that will almost never present itself organically in random conversations - ergonomic mechanical keyboards. If you have no idea what I'm talking about OR you do and you have no idea where to get started, this post is for you.

### History Lesson

Christopher Latham Sholes is a rarely-remembered member (say that 3 times fast...) of the American Industrialists, yet it is more likely that you interact with his inventions every day than, say, Henry Ford. Sholes, while disputed as the inventor of the typewriter, is certainly the inventor of the dominant layout for it and each of its predecessors... QWERTY. The [Remington No. 2](https://americanhistory.si.edu/collections/search/object/nmah_687313) typewriter was invented in 1878 saw incredible commercial success as it was the first model to include a <kbd>⇧ shift</kbd> key which allowed tying both capital and lowercase letters. This success all but solidified QWERTY as the masses got more acclimated and, thus, more resistant to change. The vast majority of typewriter or keyboard products for the following 150 years would use QWERTY.

{: .note}
**Aside**: QWERTY is not really a terrible layout - in fact it functions rather well for modern browsing which typically includes (for right handed folks) a mouse in the right hand. QWERTY is left-hand dominant in that many English words can be typed with only the left hand. This makes for great one handed typing while using the mouse to browse. It is, however, only one layout so I always suggest experimentation. Don't just [cut off the ends of the ham](https://executiveforum.com/cutting-off-the-ends-of-the-ham/).

Key layouts actually already see a lot of discourse among different communities which has led to the major OS support for remapping a keyboard to an alternative layout (Colemak, Dvorak, etc.). What's talked about less though is the **position** and **orientation** of the keys themselves. Have you ever wondered why the keys are oriented in diagonal columns? Well it might surprise you to know that it was merely a limitation of the typewriter design at the time. The levers for each key needed to be equally aligned in the half circle so they could cleanly fit under the page. In order to accommodate this, Sholes and Glidden staggered the rows of the typewriter. As the QWERTY dependency grew by year, the row-staggered orientation came along with it. 

That's the history lesson. Not so bad right? Let's get into the juicy bits now - the world of ergonomic keyboards.

## Ergonomic Keyboards

> What even are *ergonomics*?

Honestly, you'll probably get a different definition from ergonomists, corporate executives, and hobbyists like myself. What I can give you though is what I would define it as: **Adjusting your work environment to reduce risk of injury and discomfort.** What might surprise you is that what will be ergonomic for me is not what will be ergonomic for you, so take everything with a grain of salt - try it out if you're able and see what works for you. 

There are many axes through which keyboards can increase their ergonomic effectiveness, but the main ones we'll touch on in this post are:

 1. Form Factor
	 1. Structure
		 1. Split
		 2. Unibody
		 3. Monoblock
	 2. Keyboard Orientation
		 1. Tented/Sculpted
		 2. Keywells
		 3. Flat
	 3. Key Positioning
		 1. Row Staggered
		 2. Column Staggered
		 3. Ortholinear
 2. Mobility
 3. Trigger Mechanism
 4. Programmability
 5. Number of Keys

Each of these will have some tradeoffs to discuss. As a precursor to the following information, note that a "normal" keyboard can be defined as such (according to the axes above):

1. Form Factor:
	1. Structure: Unibody
	2. Keyboard Orientation: Flat
	3. Key Positioning: Row Staggered
2. Mobility: Semi-Mobile
3. Trigger Mechanism: Membrane
4. Programmability: Non-programmable
5. Number of Keys: 104 keys

{: .note}
Any keyboard *can* be ergonomic depending on its use case. Keep this in mind.

### Form Factor
The structure of a keyboard arguably has the strongest impact on ergonomic effectiveness. After all, the other factors are directly affected by the structure that you've chosen. Unfortunately, there is no universally customizable keyboard where these can all be affected smoothly so we must make sacrifices first and foremost at this level. That said, there are clear benefits for some of these subcategories that should make your choice simpler based on problems for which you are most at risk.

#### Structure
Let's start by breaking down what these terms mean:

**Split**: This is a keyboard that is separated into 2 halves - one for each hand.

**Unibody**: Not to be confused with "Unibody Split", this is a standard keyboard where the whole thing is one piece with little-to-no separation between keys.

**Monoblock**: A mixture of the two above terms, this is a single body keyboard with 2 halves dedicated to each hand and either a reasonable tilt or a considerable separation between the halves.

> Why might you want to split your keyboard?

Great question! Putting it simply, there are 2 reasons:

1. Better align your wrists when typing
2. Open up your shoulders when typing

You can imagine that since the 2 halves are freely movable, you can move them to a point where your shoulders are more relaxed and in-line with your body. This, of course, comes with the complexity of adding complexity to your workstation.

If you went with a wired split board, you'd have an additional cable to worry about in addition to a generally difficult setup to move around with since now you have twice as many "keyboards" to move.

> Why might you NOT want a split keyboard?

Aside from the cons mentioned above, there may be practical reasons for keeping with the unibody standard including, but not limited to:

1. Periodic one-handed typing
2. Wider technological support
3. Lack of shoulder/wrist pain

> And what about the monoblock thing?

This can be seen as a "Jack of All Trades but Master of None" situation where you can get some of the ergonomic benefits of a split keyboard (wrist alignment) and the mobility of a single board. This possesses many of the same issues as a single board with some added ergonomics... if you're at risk for RSI in your hands or wrists from poor alignment, this could be the solution for you.

Now that we've touched a bit on ways to reduce wrist-based and shoulder-based RSI, let's look into alleviating elbow/hand pain.

#### Keyboard Orientation
Like we did in the last section, let's establish the terminology:

##### Tenting/Sculpting
For a split board, tenting is angling the halves laterally such that using the keyboard results in less twisting of the arms than a flat board. For a monoblock/unibody board, sculpting is curving the keyboard convexly toward the user - reducing torsion in the arms. If you have cubital tunnel syndrome (like me) or general RSI in your elbows, this can reduce ulnar torsion and hopefully provide some relief. It's worth trying out if you already had a split board but it's not a panacea and should not be the only reason to get a split board. 

##### Keywells
Isolated to split keyboards, a keywell is a concavely shaped keyboard half where the keys follow along the curvature. Aside from being a very interesting conversation starter, keywells present some serious benefits by reducing motion in the fingers. The concave curvature reduces the distance between the keys and allows for non-standard finger movement to press the keys. If you happen to have pain in your hands or are at risk for that, this could be a nice-to-have feature on your list.

##### Flat
Flat keyboards are MUCH easier to come by, align closer with standard typing practices, and allow for easier chording (stay tuned for the programmability section if this is new to you). If you don't have specific pains that the key position adjustments could relieve, there's no reason not to go flat!

#### Positioning
![](https://deskthority.net/wiki/images/5/5b/Staggers_-_1.jpg){: .blog-img}

##### Row (Normal) Staggered
This is standard keyboard positioning where keys are oriented diagonally like that of an old typewriter. Extending your fingers is not a lateral motion, so this positioning provides very little ergonomic benefit. As mentioned in the [first section of this article](#history-lesson), this layout was merely a carryover from typewriter limitations so it's in no way optimal. That said, this layout is ubiquitous and learned muscle memory may make this a difficult switch.   

##### Column Staggered
Seeking adaptivity to the average human finger length, this positioning adjusts the columns such that relaxed flexation at the finger joints should place the finger on a key in the home row. Furthermore, the columns themselves are uniform so most common keys should be only a small vertical extension away, limiting lateral movement which can be the cause of RSI in some folks.

{: note}
There's also a concept of "splay" which orients the columns in accordance with the abduction of the fingers. This is meant to further conform the keyboard to the human hand by allowing a relaxed finger spread while extending. Some people swear by this but it does come with drawbacks related to chording. 

##### Ortholinear
Bucking both systems and yet more uniform than either, ortholinear positioning lays keys out in a grid of uniform distance between keys. This poses some of the ergonomic benefits of column staggering (namely limiting lateral movement), but unless your fingers happen to all be the same length, this layout makes little sense ergonomically since you will almost certainly be squishing your hand together to maintain a proper typing position. That said, chording is much easier to manage here since it is easier to stick your finger between two keys to press them both at once.

### Mobility
If you peek into any guide on ergonomics, it should mention that the most effective tool for reducing risk of injury is to change positions semi-frequently. With this in mind if you're experiencing problems with being sedentary, a better method of combating this is having a mobile setup that you can move with you to different places to allow for a more comfortable typing session. The main component of this is reducing the amount of things you have to move in order to leave your desk.

#### Wired vs Wireless
Wired keyboards are much more difficult to move than a wireless keyboard simply because of the wire. If you have a split keyboard, that issue is compounded since there is typically a wire connecting the two halves AND you have a whole 'nother keyboard half to move as well. This makes wired keyboards less desirable in terms of ergonomics. That said, wired keyboards have less maintenance since wired connections are faster and more reliable than Bluetooth and there is no required battery to power the keyboard. Wireless split boards are difficult to move, sure, but with a little [ingenuity](https://links.net/re/equip/ergoapron/), it can be even easier to move than a desktop keyboard.

### Trigger Mechanism
The mechanism by which the key is pressed does affect the ergonomics of a keyboard. Reducing errors and limiting the work that your fingers have to do is crucial to finding a comfortable typing solution.

#### Membrane Keyboards
These are usually the first think you think of when you hear "ergonomic keyboard". They are often sculpted keyboards that are usually very cheap. I advise staying away from these as they provide very little benefit over a flat keyboard. The goal for these is that your hands will be slightly less prone which can help ulnar-torsion-related RSI, but if the keyboard is really cheap, you might end up with keys getting stuck or the wear and tear may be horrendous so you'd be reversing your benefits by mashing the keys to get a proper stroke. If you must have one of these keyboards, I will only recommend the Microsoft Sculpt Keyboard which is already pretty steep (at around $100). The cost of this could be better put toward a different type of keyboard that you can remap to your liking.

#### Mecha-Membrane Keyboards
Razer is the king of these. These combine the low cost nature of membrane keyboards with a mechanical-like feel. Purists might tell you that it feels nothing like a mechanical keyboard and that wouldn't be totally incorrect - the membrane mechanism is simply too different from the mechanical switch that the feel cannot be identically replicated. It's honestly pretty close though if you have a tight budget. I have yet to see a tented, sculpted, or split version of this but any keyboard that will get you to type less is a good one.

#### Mechanical
These are often very loud and present only nominal benefits to (mecha-)membrane keyboards. One benefit is the key mechanism - the additional key travel length means you don't need to bottom-out (push the key all the way down to the bottom of the board) in order to get a stroke. You can theoretically float your hands above the keyboard and reduce impact on your fingers. This is, however, extremely hard to do consistently so it's not advised that you rely on this for your ergonomics. The other benefit is that you typically have the ability to re-map the layout. If the keyboard supports QMK/Via(l) or ZMK firmware, then you can move keys around and add key combos, chording, macros, you name it! Customization is its own form of ergonomics because you can move keys to the places that make the most sense for you, your hands, and your typing style.
For entry-level value, you really can't beat Nuphy or Keychron here. 

#### Obscure
Some switch types are unique to certain products or can only be used with a highly specific setup. I won't go into too much detail here and instead just post a list of non-affiliate links to resources if you want to read about them. Since these are so unique, if you want these trigger mechanisms, you will need to use these specific products (or get REALLY fancy with DIY) in order to use these.

### Programmability
> Programming your keyboard can affect ergonomics?

Absolutely! Let's take one very popular example of [home row mods](https://precondition.github.io/home-row-mods). These are home row keys when you tap them, and modifiers when held. This means if you need to use difficult key combinations like <kbd>⌘</kbd> + <kbd>⌥</kbd> + <kbd>⇧</kbd> + <kbd>f</kbd> for a specific application, you no longer need to contort your hand to hit these modifiers. You can keep one hand on the home row pressing the modifiers and then use the other hand to tap <kbd>f</kbd>. This can have **serious** benefits if you focus on programming your keyboard to limit motion. There are a plethora of layouts for <= 36 keys (the most popular being [Miryoku](https://github.com/manna-harbour/miryoku)) that utilize home row mods and layers to provide full keyboard functionality with limited motion. 

{: note}
If you do not have or want a programmable keyboard, you can also invest in macro pads to place some common macros in.

### Number of Keys

Finally we get to the meaning of this blog post. I made a conjecture that your keyboard has too many keys and that's because I firmly believe that the standard 100%, 75%, 60%, and even 40% keyboards are overloaded with keys that can easily be programmed into layers. This is bringing the keys to the hand instead of the opposite. 

> So how many keys should I have?

Are you ready for a non-answer?... **Less**. I say this because even if you reduced your layout down to 34 keys like the [Sweep](https://github.com/davidphilipbarr/Sweep), you should always be looking for ways to reduce your key overhead while maintaining a high typing speed/accuracy. That's the balance we hobbyists are looking for in an "endgame" keyboard.
