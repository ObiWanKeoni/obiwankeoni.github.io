      <p>In this _ part series, we will dive into the Software Engineering job market and how to succeed in it. This will take a rant-like tone but it will be a holistic viewpoint from someone who has lived experience.</p>

<h3 id="who-the-heck-even-are-you-why-should-i-listen-to-you">WHO THE HECK EVEN ARE YOU? WHY SHOULD I LISTEN TO YOU?</h3>
<p>I am a Sr. Software Engineer with about a decade of experience. Does that even mean anything anymore? Anyway, I’ve seen it all from contracting to full time employment at both startups and large Fortune X00 organizations. As you read my takes, I think you’ll either understand exactly what I mean or you’ll think I’m batshit crazy. If you’re the latter, I hope you’ll be back when you see the light like I have.</p>

<h1 id="everything-you-know-is-wrong">Everything you know is wrong</h1>
<p>I’ve seen and heard it countless times. The benevolent coding wizards of the industry graciously impart wisdom on how to succeed as a Software Engineer that is something to the tune of:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Work your ass off and give your life to the company. That’s how I did it.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Here’s the thing though - circumstances are vastly different. Engineers come out of bootcamps with more up-to-date engineering practices than those from universities. 10-year-olds know more about software than you ever will. All hope is lost… or is it?</p>

<p>The mantra above is just one of the many examples of outdated career advancement advice. It was often given to me unsolicited. I was not always against it either and it worked out early in my career so I don’t want to write it off completely, but there are circumstances that are more conducive to this kind of work ethic. As with most things, it depends on your specific situation. I’m not here to tell you what to do ehrn</p>
